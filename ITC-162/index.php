 <p>Hi, my name is Morgan, I'm attending Seattle Central to get a Web Development Certificate.</p>
 <p>Over the years I've worked with rotting meat in corporate hell, been a greasy inebriated line cook, and I escaped the fiery unstable kitchen life only to become a lowly carpet walking bus boy. </p>
 <p>Enough was enough, I had to figure something out. I mustered my strength, got my GED, and tried to enroll in the Graphic Arts program at Seattle Central.
  I got denied so hard that I questioned if my artisitc talent was actually a delusional break from reality.
 So I thought "Graphic <b>design</b>, web <b>DESIGN</B> ha HA!" I figured it out, I'll do that thing!  When I attended the mandatory ITC 102 class I was told that AI was going to destroy all web design jobs or something like that, very dramatic, web design turned to web development and here I am trying my best. </p>
