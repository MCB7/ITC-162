   <p>Shopping carts are an essential part of e-commerce and there are manys of creating one for your website. There are some steps required for a shopping cart to function properly, one being the credit card process.  A Credit card can be processed through a third party program but will require a percentage of the transaction.  There is the General Processing option which takes responsibility of transferring funds and verifying information.  They are good for small businesses and require a 2.5% - 3.5% charge of all transactions.  The Merchant Account is another option, it can move the customers funds from their bank account directly into yours, This process has the banks authenticate the funds rather then the Processor.  The fee from this is cents rather then the potentially more expensive percentage take of the General Processing.  The Merchant Account does however require a monthly subscription to this service,  usually costing around $30.  The Third option is Paypal, being similar to General Processing requiring a 1.9% - 3.4% charge on every transaction.  An additional feature PayPal offers is an instore card reader.

   <p>Some of the established Web Shopping Cart services are plugins through Wordpress,  one is called WooCommerce, it offers customization to its functionality, being able to be set up with PayPal and giving you full control of shipping rate, categories, and inventory management.  A Code free option is a Canadia based platform called “Shopify”, its setup and use is completely streamlined and accepts all major credit cards.  Like the Merchant account it does require a monthly subscription of $30 but there is less hassle when it comes to operating it.  Ecwid boasts an even easier setup promising that using it is  “as simple as adding a YouTube video.”  It is able to be used through Instagram, Facebook, and wordpress.
