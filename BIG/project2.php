 <p>A gallery has the potential to turn a plain boring website into a dynamic platform that  can attract visitors and customers by the ability it has to convey a product, making it a more memorable experience for the user.  There are many ways to display a gallery on a website, you can use simple CSS or Javascript. An example for a Javascript gallery example would be Gallery.js, 
“Gallerly.js is a pure JavaScript photo gallery that lets you create a thumbnail grid with an expanding large image preview as you seen on Google Image Search.</p>
<p>The CSS example I found  is called “CSSBox” a minimal, responsive image gallery lightbox where the user is able to navigate between full sized images in a fullscreen lightbox popup. Built using CSS / CSS3 and plain html markup.</p>
<p>Creating a gallery for your website could also lead to monetary gain.  integrating display ads with photo content overrides many common ad blocks and other software that usually prevents users from seeing ads.  Also the more galleries you have on your websites increases the images which affects the likelihood your website will appear in image searches, bringing more visitors.</p>
<p>Lead Generator is a tool that can be integrated into your HTML photo gallery. It asks users for their name and email in order to view content.  Lead has an automated email list creator, saving user information for later use such as an email campaign.  You can make the lead generator feature skippable or not and where in the photo gallery it'll activate.  </p>
<p>There are many websites that showcase award winning and unique website galleries.  One website I found was called “siteInspire.com”.  It is a minimally designed showcase of other galleries around the web, curated by Daniel Howe.
